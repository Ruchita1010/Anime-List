# Anime-List
A simple website for searching animes and find more about them

## Motivation
It's quite cumbersome to search animes on MAL due to the very poor UI.
So, I thought of making a simple and easy site for searching anime and 
view basic information about it.

## Technologies
Build with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript

## Roadmap
* On clicking "learn more" button, detailed information about the anime to be displayed
* Allow users to add/bookmark their favorite anime
